# Book-Record-Management
This is a Book Record Management Project using Nodejs, Express, MongoDb and Postman.
Created an API Backend for the management of records of Books and Users.
Book & User Management: Developed a backend API using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB for managing books (CRUD operations) and users (registration, borrowing, and returns).

API Testing & Validation: Implemented and tested RESTful APIs using Postman, with proper input validation and error handling to ensure data integrity.

Data Handling: Utilized Mongoose for efficient database schema design, allowing seamless relationships between books and users, tracking borrowing history and availability.
